I did this work on my own.
to run: java -jar build/libs/A2.jar

Pretty well finished, a little rough around the edges.

Exceptions all work, and it will create doors for a room without doors,
place items on empty tiles only, prevent the player from walking through walls,
and exclude items without a valid id.

The game will display information in the message above the room,
such as the name of an item picked up, the name of the room you're in,
movement direction and player coordinates.

CONTROLS:
Up: w, i
Down: s, k
Left; a, j
Right d, l
